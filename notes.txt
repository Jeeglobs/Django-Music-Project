added link to add an album in index.html as per Gerardo's example

sketched out new view functions for editing and deleting albums, and one for getting info
these functions have not been written yet

created edit_album.html, delete_album.html, and get_info.html
these files are empty but will connect to view functions

created paths for the empty view functions and html files

added if loop to add_album in views.py
as per class example and Gerardo's example

on line 124-126 in settings.py, wrote code needed for CSS styling as per Michael's example in class.
this code is currently commented out

edit_album link and page are working, my home link from edit is huge for some reason
